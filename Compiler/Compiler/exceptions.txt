lexer parses a lexeme "2number" as "int" and "IDENTIFIER",
instead of "UNDEFINED"
left for parser to handle it

not every single operation is there

if complex operations like sizof(), ::, are even there, they're
made tokens of, but unable to parse through

Program works in such way-
	headers → declarations → main
anything out of that order will result in an error

Other than only that, it can work with out of order case as well

Declarations will not give speacial case runtime errors, i.e
"ExpectedIntLit" if expressions are assigned to variables. Yet.
